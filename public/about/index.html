<p>I&rsquo;m a graduate student at OHSU, in the <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/vollum/faculty/baconguislab.cfm">Baconguis lab</a>.
We work on structural
biochemistry, specifically cryoEM of ion channels. Check out our
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39340">first</a> and
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59038">second</a> papers on the structure and function of ENaC!</p>
<p>In addition to protein biochemistry, I enjoy writing scripts to help make repeat
analysis easier. If you don&rsquo;t ask <a href="https://twitter.com/CryoEM_PNCC/status/1375582415326879746">a national lab</a>,
my only notable work is <a href="https://github.com/PlethoraChutney/Appia">Appia</a>,
a chromatography analysis package which collates and plots data from Waters, Shimadzu, and
AKTA instruments with a web interface that you can access from anywhere.
I got tired of copying files and making .csvs manually! Check out a <a href="https://traces.baconguislab.com">live
web demo</a>!</p>
<p>I also was one of the first organizers for our union, <a href="https://gradresearchersunited.org">Graduate Researchers United</a>.
I went on to become a lead organizer, then a member of the bargaining team, and
a member of the first (<em>de facto</em>) executive board. I am very passionate about
unions, and I think they&rsquo;re one of the few levers of power held firmly in our hands.
If you want to organize, please send me an email or a tweet, or an anonymous letter.
I will always make time to discuss strategy, challenges, and benefits.</p>
