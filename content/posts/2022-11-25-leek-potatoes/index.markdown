[*Take me to the recipe*](#ingredients)

It was just Thanksgiving here yesterday, which I have complicated feelings
about. It was always a big holiday for my family growing up, and so I have a
nostalgic fondness for it. And I celebrate it by spending all day cooking
(my favorite activity) for my favorite people, then spending all night
drinking wine I can really only barely afford and eating all the food we made
(my second favorite activity). So it's got a lot going for it. But it's also
attached a founding myth of my horrible, horrible country. And at the end of
the day, it's kind of a whitewashing/celebration of genocide.

That is an unlikely introductory paragraph to a recipe, but perhaps an understandable
one for a *Thanksgiving* recipe. In any case, ever since I could hold a knife
I was put in charge of mashed potatoes. At the risk of sounding too much like
James "Mash King" Acaster, there's more to them than meets the eye, I think.

I always make leek mashed potatoes. I think leeks are the perfect midway point
between onions and chives, and they break up the fatty/starchy pile on your plate
with some truly beautiful green. I was lucky enough this year to be able to grab
some huge, gorgeous leeks from the farmer's market on Wednesday! This was at the tail
end of a three-and-a-half mile walk, carrying progressively more and more produce
and wine. Right at the end the sun painted the entire sky the most beautiful
orange and pink. I texted all my friends, insisting they go outside. If I were a poet
I'd have more to say about a long walk with a big reward mirroring how I feel about
Thanksgiving, but I'm not, so I don't.

This year was also my first year making a fermented cashew crema for the potatoes, to replace
the buttermilk I used to use before I was vegan. I am not going to try to convert
you. If you like, you should make this recipe with buttermilk and real butter.
But even if you're not vegan and don't want to be, I really encourage you to
try vegan cooking, and especially fermentation. It will open up a whole new world
of possibility for you! If it gives you any indication of how good these taste
even without dairy, there was still a chicken at my table, but nobody ever wants
a non-vegan mash.

I think, with that, we can get to the good stuff.

# Ingredients

Now, this list makes a **lot** of potatoes. At least 24 servings, I'd reckon.
I love mashed potatoes and so does
everyone else. That means people take a lot, and want to take a lot home. Potatoes
are also very cheap. Why not give the people what they want? But do be sure to
check that you have a pot big enough before embarking on making this quantity.

## Crema
 * 1 &frac12; cups cashews
 * 1&ndash;2 Tbsp of anything with live cultures in it. I use vegan yogurt (cocojune)
 to start, and then the last bit of a previous batch from there on.
 
## Potatoes
 * 8 lbs russet potatoes
 * 6 big leeks, dark-green parts trimmed off and used in stock for gravy
 * 8 Tbsp fat of your choice (I use 50% fake butter, 50% coconut oil, but
 do whatever feels right)
 
# Process

## Crema

If you do not have a high-speed blender (i.e., Vitamix), soak your cashews overnight
in water. Dump the water out and proceed. Make the crema the morning of the same
day you want to serve at the latest, since it ought to ferment for about 8 hours.

 1. Blend **1 cup** (not all) cashews and 1 cup water until smooth. If you can't get it totally smooth, that's
 okay --- fermentation will finish the job. You want it to be a *little* thicker
 than buttermilk, as fermentation will thin it out. Add cashews and water until you
 get to the right consistency.
 2. Add your live cultures and blend just to mix.
 3. Pour into a jar, leave on the counter for about eight hours.
 4. Use immediately, or refrigerate. A week is probably fine, but once you taste
 it I guarantee it won't even last that long.
 
## Potatoes

The enemy of a fluffy mashed potato is water. Adding the potato chunks back to
the pot and cooking out some of the steam really helps fluff things up. Shoutout
to my sister's boyfriend Wes for teaching me that trick. Another thing that helps
is getting all the potatoes coated in fat *before* adding the liquid. This shields
the starch from all that new water. You also should mix just enough to...well...mix.
Trying to fluff things up by "whipping" them will only make it worse.

If you want to get a head-start on making these (by an hour or two, don't like
leave cooked potatoes lying around), go ahead and cook the potatoes
and cook the steam out of them and wash and cut the leeks, but don't cook them
yet or mash the potatoes. Then, when you're about ready to serve, cook the leeks
and proceed as usual, but heat up the crema nice and hot before adding it to
the potatoes. This should warm everything up nicely without requiring you to over-cook
the potatoes. In all though, these only take about 45 minutes to make.

 1. Peel your potatoes, or not. I do.
 1. Cut leeks in quarters along their long axis (i.e., making four long thin
 leek quarters) and wash all down between the layers. Then cut into quarter-inch slices.
 2. Cut into approximately half-inch chunks. Drop the chunks into a big pot of
 heavily salted room-temp water as you do, so they don't turn brown.
 3. Add four or five bay leaves to the pot.
 4. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer. Cook until inserting a butter knife requires
 no force and breaks the chunk apart, but doesn't turn it to total mush. I start checking
 around 5 minutes after the water boils.
 4. While potatoes boil, add 3 Tbsp fat to your biggest pan and saute the leeks
 and a heavy pinch of salt until just translucent. Turn off the heat and add the
 rest of the fat to melt it.
 5. Strain. Discard bay leaves.
 6. Return potatoes to pot over medium-low heat. Stir chunks with a wooden spoon
 constantly. Lots of steam will come out of the pot during this process. Don't worry
 about smashing the chunks, we're about to mash them anyway. Continue
 until a thin layer of potatoes covers the bottom of the pot, five minutes if that.
 7. Mash the potatoes. I like to leave some larger chunks for texture.
 8. Add leeks and fat. Mix, trying to get the fat evenly distributed throughout.
 9. Add your crema. Mix.
 10. Season. I like to keep it simple, with salt and just a bit of black pepper.
 Most people eat these covered in gravy, so all your herbs and flavors will come
 from there. I wouldn't begrudge you a bit of smoked paprika, sage, or roasted
 garlic though.
 
 
 Really, these are very good. Give them a try!
