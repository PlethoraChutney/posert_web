![Baked turmeric chili buns in a 9-inch cake pan.](baked-buns.jpg)

This is a really great recipe I made up a year or two ago.
It's based on the butter rolls from [Jeffrey Hamelman's *Bread*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/bread-a-baker-s-book-of-techniques-and-recipes/18858217).
Those rolls are truly excellent and you can eat a whole pan on their own.
However, I wanted something a little more fun.

Adding just a bit of turmeric for color and chili for smoke and heat makes these simply the best thing you'll ever eat.
I use [Diaspora Co.'s Sir훮rakhong H훮thei Chillies](https://www.diasporaco.com/collections/chillies/products/sirarakhong-hathei-chillies?variant=42726145949867) for this and just about anything that calls for heat and smoke.
I cannot overstate how incredible these chilis are.

# Ingredients
 * 17.6 oz bread flour
 * 1 Tbsp sugar
 * 2 tsp kosher salt (half as much if table salt)
 * 1 Tbsp instant yeast
 * 1/2 tsp turmeric
 * 1 -- 1 &frac12; tsp chilli powder (see note)
 * 3 Tbsp softened butter or olive oil
 * 8.1 oz water
 * 2.5 oz milk

## Notes
If you don't have Sir훮rakhong H훮thei chillies, you can use a mixture of cayenne and smoked paprika.

# Process
1. Line the bottom of a 9 inch cake pan with parchment and grease the inside.
1. Put all the dry ingredients into a bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk to combine.
1. Add the butter, water, and milk.
2. Mix and knead until the dough is smooth and supple, about 5 minutes in a stand mixer.
3. Cover and let rest until dough has doubled in size, 30 -- 60 minutes. No need to fold.
4. Cut dough into 24 approximately equal pieces and roll into balls. If you haven't shaped rolls before, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktWciCa_UDg). They'll be much smaller than those, but the technique there is important for getting nice and even rolls.
5. Place each roll into the cake pan as you shape it. The 24 rolls will only just fit in the tin and will be touching each other --- this is good!
6. Preheat the oven to 400 &deg;F.
6. Cover and let rise until rolls are very puffy and almost completely touching each other, approximately 30 minutes. ![Before and after the proofing step. Note that the buns puff up and fully occupy the pan during the proof.](proof-step.png)
7. Bake for 20 -- 25 minutes until the rolls are golden brown on top.
8. Right when the rolls come out of the oven, brush with more melted butter or olive oil and sprinkle flaky finishing salt on top.
9. Let cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out and serve warm!
